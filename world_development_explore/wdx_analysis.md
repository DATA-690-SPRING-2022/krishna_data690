**Countries Considered:** USA,INDIA,CHINA AND FRANCE.

**TIME FRAME CONSIDERED**: 2010-2020

## **Access to Electricity(% of Population) Among The Countries Considered**:

The United States of America, China, and India are the world's first, second, and third largest economies, respectively, but their per capita income ranks 13th, 79th, and 122nd among all other countries. France is chosen at random since it is one of the most visited countries on the planet. The population of these countries, on the other hand, is in stark contrast to their GDP per capita income. The United States is the world's third most populous country, India is the world's second most populous country, and China is the world's most populous country. India and China, with a combined population of 2.7 billion people, account for 37 percent of the world's population. In comparison to other countries, France has a population of about 60 million people.

With such a large population, these countries' residents have a significant demand for power. The populations of these countries have varying levels of access to electricity. Although the United States, China, and France are economically powerful, only 76.3 percent of the Indian population has access to electricity, which is rapidly approaching 100%.
