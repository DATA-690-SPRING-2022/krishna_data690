**Countries Considered:** USA,INDIA,CHINA AND FRANCE.

**TIME FRAME CONSIDERED**: 2010-2020

## **Access to Electricity(% of Population) Among The Countries Considered**:

The United States of America, China, and India are the world's first, second, and third largest economies, respectively, but their per capita income ranks 13th, 79th, and 122nd among all other countries. France is chosen at random since it is one of the most visited countries on the planet. The population of these countries, on the other hand, is in stark contrast to their GDP per capita income. The United States is the world's third most populous country, India is the world's second most populous country, and China is the world's most populous country. India and China, with a combined population of 2.7 billion people, account for 37 percent of the world's population. In comparison to other countries, France has a population of about 60 million people.

With such a large population, these countries' residents have a significant demand for power. The populations of these countries have varying levels of access to electricity. Although the United States, China, and France are economically powerful, only 76.3 percent of the Indian population has access to electricity, which is rapidly approaching 100%.

## **Electric Power Consumption**

Despite the fact that these countries have vastly different populations, their electricity usage is not the same. When compared to India, the United States consumes more than 13 times the amount of electricity. The United States uses the most power of the four countries, while India uses the least.

In general, the amount of power produced and used by a country can be used to estimate pollution. The above inference demonstrates that the second most populated country utilized the least amount of electricity.

## **Production Of Electricity Among The Considered Countries**:

While these countries have distinct needs and capabilities for generating power for their inhabitants, the methods utilized by each country have been vastly diverse. Let's take a closer look at the three different methods that each of these countries generates electricity. Fossil fuels, renewable energy sources, and nuclear power are all options. These capabilities are present in all fourÂ countries.

### FOSSIL FUELS:

Coal is commonly employed in the creation of electricity because it is relatively inexpensive to source, transport, and manage. When it comes to electricity generation, this also has a cheap initial and ongoing investment. All four of these countries rely on coal for electricity generation, which is also the most polluting, as it produces more CO2 and other hazardous emissions. China has the highest use of fossil-fuel-generated electricity, followed by India. The United States and France are right behind India in terms of fossil-fuel-generated energy consumption. Oil and gas are the other two fossil fuels used to generate electricity.

While these are used seldom in all four countries, when they are, they add to pollution. When it comes to oil as a source of energy for power generation, India consumes over 2.5 percent, while the United States and France use about 1%. When compared to the other two countries, China utilizes far less. Furthermore, natural gas is the most widely used fuel for electricity generation in the United States, followed by France, India, and China. In 2015, India, China, and the United States produced 81.2 percent of their electricity from coal, oil, and gas, compared to 79.4 percent in India, 79.4 percent in China, 70.27 percent in the United States, and 10% in France. Among the four countries, France has the lowest production rate.

When it comes to electricity production, the United States and China utilize far more fossil fuels to meet their needs. With the size of these fossil fuels used to generate power. It can be claimed that the pollution produced by this will be significantly greater, as will the environmental damage.

## RENEWABLE ELECTRICITY OUTPUT:

Hydroelectric power plants are the most environmentally friendly renewable energy sources available. In 2015, hydropower and other renewable energy sources accounted for 16.04 percent of total electricity produced in India. China generates 18.6% of its total electricity from renewable sources. France, on the other hand, produced 13.8 percent of the country's total resources. At the same time, the United States has 10.12% of its total from the same. This demonstrates that India and China have significantly more hydroelectric and other renewable energy production potential than France and the United States.

## ELECTRICITY PRODUCTION FROM NUCLEAR SOURCES:

Nuclear energy, above all other choices, can be declared to be the future of power production in general and with confidence. All of these countries have the necessary access and capability. Nuclear power generates 75.94 percent of electricity in France, while nuclear power generates 19.2 percent of electricity in the United States. While India has a small 2.6 percent footprint, China has an even smaller 1.7 percent footprint.

We can clearly observe that France genereates the most Nuclear power Energy.

## CONCLUSION:

To summarize, the amount of electricity produced and consumed is proportionate to the amount of pollution produced by that country. We can observe that the more a country relies on fossil fuels to meet its energy needs, the more pollution it produces. The easiest approach to deal with this is to switch to renewable energy sources for energy production. They, too, face difficulties in terms of initial investment and other restraints. Even while nuclear power is a viable option, it is both costly and inconvenient to maintain for any government, especially developing countries.The difficulties associated with the extraction of fossil fuels and the resulting pollution are a reality that must be addressed.
